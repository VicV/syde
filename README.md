# Flying Autonomous Litter Collection (FALCN)

### In short

This application is to work with a DJI Phantom Drone. It combines the DJI SDK with OpenCV to allow for autonomous surveying of an area, then travels to litter to collect it. Developed for Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. 

Of course, you would need the grabber we built to use this, but if you're ever looking for a combination of any of the following, this page is a good starting point. 

* DJI SDK (OLD! For Phantom 2)
* OpenCV (MODIFIED! The included AAR has no memory leaks)
* The above two but on a Nexus 6p
* Google Maps with Route Optimization
* Google Maps with Polygon Creation and Dragging
* Autonomous DJI Phantom 2
* DJI Phantom 2 Control System (for stabilization over objects)
* Android Camera OpenCV Processing
* Getting DJIGLSurfaceView to Bitmap

And much more..
